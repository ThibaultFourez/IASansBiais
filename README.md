# 3. Correcting bias by modifying the decision rule for prediction problems
##  3.1 Modifying the threshold in logistic model.
### Reduction approach: 
In this notebook, we applied our algorithm on database Adult_Income. We developed our algorithm of modification the threshold in part 6 on the notebook developed by M.BESSE. 

## 3.2 Using different algorithms/models prediction
We applied the different prediction models and use the resultat of analysis developed by M.BESSE
